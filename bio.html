<p>I am an accomplished data scientist who loves analyzing information in order to see the bigger picture. I love reading, learning about history and different cultures, traveling,
    playing video games, watching movies and having a good time with my friends. I am also a Barrett honors graduate from Arizona State University within the School of earth and Space Exploration.
    My concentration was Astrobiology and Biogeosciences and I love learning about science and the mysteries of the Universe.
</p>
<p>I am relatively new to the data science profession but the University of Arizona Data Analytics Bootcamp has taught me so much related to the technical skills required to survive in this field.
    My skills include Excel, Python 3, SQL, HTML, CSS, and other programming languages related to analytics and I am a fast learner with an enthusiasm for new experiences.
